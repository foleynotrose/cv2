		<p>
			My name is <strong>Emily Axel</strong>. I'm a social worker with 15 years' experience in the non-profit sector, helping people solve all kinds of problems. I'm passionate about providing people with a positive experience—making sure they are heard, understood, and guided to the right solutions. I'm excited to try something new and bring these strengths to a customer support role.

    <h2>Empathetic Listening</h2>
<p>I’ve worked with a variety of groups and individuals, supporting them with everything from small practical issues, like how to use a smartphone or set up an email account, all the way up to major crises, like facing eviction or bereavement. I am an excellent reflective listener and always make sure I understand what the problem is before trying to solve it. I stay calm under pressure and know how to de-escalate stressful situations.</p>
<h2>Problem Solving</h2>
<p>I’m a fast learner and pick up new tools quickly. My current team has adopted new software to streamline our internal communications and I’ve become the informal sysadmin to support this transition. My success in that role has relied on my ability to communicate technical information without talking down to my listeners, many of whom are less comfortable with technology.</p>
<br></br>

<p>My social work training comes in very handy, even when explaining how cloud storage or Trello works. I can easily put myself in someone else’s shoes, sense when they are getting frustrated and adjust my approach accordingly. I guide them to reframe the information with the right details so we can work together to solve the problem—moving from “it’s not working, I give up!” to “when I try to do X, I get Y message.”</p>
<h2>Written and Verbal Communication</h2>
<p>I adapt my style to fit the listener, whether I’m communicating with a colleague, an older resident of a care home, an elected official, or the general public. I am an advocate of plain-language writing that is clear, concise, and contains the right amount of detail. I have broad experience writing case notes, reports, and website content, as well as submitting and interacting with bug reports for the apps and sites I use.</p>
<br></br>
<p>As Age Friendly Campaign Officer, I successfully distilled input from more than 200 older people around Leeds into a well-designed and easy-to-read <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/assets.timetoshine.co.uk/AF-Charter-Digital.pdf">Age Friendly Charter</a>.</p>
<br></br>
<p>I also managed the programme's <a href="https://www.timetoshineleeds.org">website</a> and write most of the content.</p>
